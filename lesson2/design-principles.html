       <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
       <h3>Sandis</h3>
       <p><a href = "https://www.sandis.net/">Sandis.net</a></p>
       <img src = "images/sandis.jpeg" alt = "Sandis mobile website" width = 300>
       <p>The first image that is displayed on the Sandis website demonstrates the Rule of Thirds. The reason that This
           image is able to catch a reader's attention is because of the emphasis that is placed on the sky. 2/3rds of the
           image are focused on the sky while the other 1/3 is focused on the ground. If the image had not been captured in 
           2/3rds, it would be less interesting.

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>Dropbox</h3>
        <p><a href = "https://www.dropbox.com/?_hp=c&landing=dbv2">Dropbox.com</a></p>
        <img src = "images/dropbox.jpeg" alt = "Dropbox mobile website" width = 300>
        <p>As can be seen on the Dropbox website, there is plenty of space between the different elements on the page.
            The letters and elements are not too close together, and the text that is in the middle of boxes is not 
            too close the edges. The Overall desing of the site is clean as well. None of the elements on the page look
            cluttered.
        </p>

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <h3>Typeform</h3>
        <p><a href = "https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform.com</a></p>
        <img src = "images/typeform.jpeg" alt = "Typeform mobile website" width = 300>
        <p>The Typeform website is able to get the reader's attention immediately as the text is formatted off the left of 
            the page. This is also something that is noticeable on the others sections that are contained on the website.
            Having the text aligned on the left side of the screen also makes it easier to read.
